#   HEALTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18789/health
#   PING_URL=https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid-here
#   EXPECTED_PYTHON=/Users/you/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-3.12.13-.../bin/python3.12
#   VENV_PYTHON=/Users/you/Code/things-mcp/.venv/bin/python
#   MAX_WAL_AGE=0        # 0 disables the staleness check
#
# Everything is optional except HEALTH_URL. Without PING_URL it just prints its
# findings and exits non-zero on a problem, which is useful for running by hand.
